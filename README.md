Here I will store Pov-Ray scripts for 3D-modeling. For an intro have a look at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wuzFq1qrKk&amp;t=1s

Pov-Ray is a script-based raytracer ... Due to this script-based character, Pov-Ray is ideal for modeling natural structures based on certain sets of rules.

I will start show-casing this ability of Pov-Ray with structures obeying very simple rules, snail shells.
