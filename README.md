# ModelingNature - Basic structures
Here I will store Pov-Ray scripts for 3D-modeling. For an intro have a look at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wuzFq1qrKk&amp;t=1s

Pov-Ray is a script-based raytracer ... Due to this script-based character, Pov-Ray is ideal for modeling natural structures based on certain sets of rules.

01SnailShells: I will start show-casing this ability of Pov-Ray with structures obeying very simple rules, snail shells. An accompanying video is available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASQYtnoF-IY&t=315s

02GoldenAngle: Many plant structures can be modeled by applying the golden angle 137.5 degrees. As an example I have included a model of the leaf arrangement of an Aeonium plant here. Leaves are arranged on a spiral with subsequent rotations of 137.5 degrees. An accompanying video is available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70ocaMix5X4&t=7s
