# ModelingNature - Basic structures
Here I will store Pov-Ray scripts for 3D-modeling. For an intro have a look at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wuzFq1qrKk&amp;t=1s. Here I start with an initial chapter about very basic rules.

Pov-Ray is a script-based raytracer ... Due to this script-based character, Pov-Ray is ideal for modeling natural structures based on certain sets of rules. In this starting chapter I will show some very basic sets of rules. 

01SnailShells: I will start show-casing this ability of Pov-Ray with structures obeying very simple rules, snail shells. An accompanying video is available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASQYtnoF-IY&t=315s

02GoldenAngle: Many plant structures can be modeled by applying the golden angle 137.5 degrees. As an example I have included a model of the leaf arrangement of an Aeonium plant here. Leaves are arranged on a spiral (marked in white color below) with subsequent rotations of 137.5 degrees. Respective positions are labeled in green color below.

03Erythrocyte: Erythrocytes can be modeled easily by applying planar, polar distributions with slight distortions and enlarged elements in the outer rings. An accompanying video is available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ6s94Gj7w4&t=138s

04SphericalDistributions: Spherical (or 3D polar) distributions can be used to model shapes like leukocytes or enveloped viruses.

05CartesianBackgrounds: Apart from spherical distributions, there are cartesian distributions. They can be used to distribute things in the background. To make things appear somewhat natural, a certain amount of variability should be included. An accompanying video is available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yswzMS0wcM

06CartesianTissue: Here Cartesian distributions are used to model certain biological tissues. First we model a sponge-like tissue, then a tissue made of cells separated by large distances and connected by long extensions.
